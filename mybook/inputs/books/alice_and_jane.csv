11,CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,conversations?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,close by her.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,rabbit-hole under the hedge.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,in the world she was to get out again.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,well.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she fell past it.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,of the house!' (Which was very likely true.),Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,from the roof.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,get out again.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,impossible.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,letters.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"see whether it's marked ""poison"" or not'; for she had read several nice",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,telescope.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,ever having seen such a thing.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,sat down and cried.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,in the common way.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,_I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"     ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"       HEARTHRUG,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"         NEAR THE FENDER,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,           (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,key and hurried off to the garden door.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,deep and reaching half down the hall.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,see if she could have been changed for any of them.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Mabel! I'll try and say ""How doth the little--""' and she crossed her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,same as they used to do:--,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,     'How doth the little crocodile,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"      Improve his shining tail,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,     And pour the waters of the Nile,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,      On every golden scale!,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"     'How cheerfully he seems to grin,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"      How neatly spread his claws,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,     And welcome little fishes in,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,      With gently smiling jaws!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"use their putting their heads down and saying ""Come up again, dear!"" I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"shall only look up and say ""Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"till I'm somebody else""--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,of being all alone here!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,was nine feet high.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"However, everything is queer to-day.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,slipped in like herself.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,but it said nothing.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,YOU like cats if you were me?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,more if you'd rather not.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the pool as it went.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"age, there was no more to be said.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ""William",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,you speak?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. ""Edwin and Morcar,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"""it"" means.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I know what ""it"" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '""--found",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Normans--"" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to Alice as it spoke.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,dry me at all.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,remedies--',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,tittered audibly.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,you how the Dodo managed it.),Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,a-piece all round.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,could.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,begged the Mouse to tell them something more.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,would be offended again.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,sighing.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,back to finish his story.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,had vanished completely.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,had made.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,fan and gloves.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '""Miss Alice! Come",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"here directly, and get ready for your walk!"" ""Coming in a minute,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out."" Only I don't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,began ordering people about like that!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,drunk quite so much!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"again, no wonder she felt unhappy.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,for any lesson-books!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a voice outside, and stopped to listen.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,go round and get in at the window.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"for apples, yer honour!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.),Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,window!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,go down the chimney!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,I THINK I can kick a little!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was),Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,see what would happen next.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,us all about it!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,which produced another dead silence.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"make me smaller, I suppose.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,safe in a thick wood.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the best plan.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,great hurry.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,all her coaxing.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"question is, what?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,was on the top of it.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"her in a languid, sleepy voice.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,changed several times since then.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,yourself!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"myself, you see.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,different sizes in a day is very confusing.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"queer, won't you?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"is, it would feel very queer to ME.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Why?' said the Caterpillar.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"state of mind, she turned away.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,could.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'No,' said the Caterpillar.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"you're changed, do you?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, I've tried to say ""HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,"" but it all came",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Repeat, ""YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,""' said the Caterpillar.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"Alice folded her hands, and began:--",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,    'And your hair has become very white;,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"    Do you think, at your age, it is right?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,    'I feared it might injure the brain;,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,    Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,have got altered.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,there was silence for some minutes.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The Caterpillar was the first to speak.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'What size do you want to be?' it asked.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"doesn't like changing so often, you know.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,offended!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,grow shorter.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,of the edge with each hand.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,sea of green leaves that lay far below her.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,was beating her violently with its wings.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to suit them!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,serpents! There's no pleasing them!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,see its meaning.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,invent something!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the number of changes she had gone through that day.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,egg!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,know.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,whether you're a little girl or a serpent?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,like them raw.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,had brought herself down to nine inches high.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"door, staring stupidly up into the sky.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"repeated, aloud.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,as if nothing had happened.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"question, you know.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,It's enough to drive one crazy!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,days and days.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'But what am I to do?' said Alice.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,as well as she could for sneezing.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,your cat grins like that?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that cats COULD grin.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,pleased to have got into a conversation.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,it twelve? I--',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,that Alice could hardly hear the words:--,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'I speak severely to my boy,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,yourself.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,tears.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,tree a few yards off.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,felt that it ought to be treated with respect.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'I don't much care where--' said Alice.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,enough.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'What sort of people live about here?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,You're mad.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,do you know that you're mad?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I suppose so,' said Alice.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Queen to-day?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,yet.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,it suddenly appeared again.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,forgotten to ask.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,in a natural way.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"again, sitting on a branch of a tree.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,remained some time after the rest of it had gone.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,suppose it doesn't mind.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the March Hare.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,many more than three.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,severity; 'it's very rude.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,March Hare.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Exactly so,' said Alice.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"say--that's the same thing, you know.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that ""I see what I eat"" is the same thing as ""I eat what I see""!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that ""I like what I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"get"" is the same thing as ""I get what I like""!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"talking in his sleep, 'that ""I breathe when I sleep"" is the same thing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"as ""I sleep when I breathe""!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,which wasn't much.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and holding it to his ear.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,you know.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,tell what o'clock it is!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,year it is?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,stays the same year for such a long time together.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,hot tea upon its nose.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,again.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Nor I,' said the March Hare.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,about wasting IT. It's HIM.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,when I learn music.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,time for dinner!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,half-past one as long as you liked.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"     ""Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"said, 'It was a treacle-well.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,dare say there may be ONE.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,all of them bowed low.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,those roses?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and waited.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,all. I needn't be afraid of them!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"courtiers, or three of her own children.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"the royal children, and everybody else.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,to Alice for protection.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,others.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,evidently meant for her.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,'Yes!' shouted Alice.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,wondering very much what would happen next.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,sentence of execution.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'What for?' said Alice.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Did you say ""What a pity!""?' the Rabbit asked.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Queen said--',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,minute.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,left alive!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,enough for it to speak with.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,it ran away when it saw mine coming!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The Queen smiled and passed on.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,at the Cat's head with great curiosity.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,introduce it.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,kiss my hand if it likes.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,He got behind Alice as he spoke.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,but I don't remember where.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,have this cat removed!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,hurried off.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,sort of way to fly up into a tree.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,friend.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,what they said.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.),Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,you'd better ask HER about it.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,And the executioner went off like an arrow.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11," The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,they walked off together.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,savage when they met in the kitchen.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"stingy about it, you know--'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,a bit.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she spoke.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,bore it as well as she could.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the conversation a little.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--""Oh, 'tis love,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,croquet-ground.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,cost them their lives.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,under sentence of execution.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,you seen the Mock Turtle yet?',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,number of executions the Queen had ordered.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,after that savage Queen: so she waited.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"half to itself, half to Alice.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"   'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"her, to pass away the time.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"herself, 'because of his great wig.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,just as well.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"down yet, before the trial's begun.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,was talking.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"   'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,      All on a summer day:,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,      And took them quite away!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,deal to come before that!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,my tea when I was sent for.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was,' he said.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,reduced the answer to shillings and pence.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,memorandum of the fact.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,my own. I'm a hatter.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,who turned pale and fidgeted.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,you executed on the spot.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,bread-and-butter.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,long as there was room for her.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,too.',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,other side of the court.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"executed, whether you're nervous or not.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,take me for a dunce? Go on!',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,that--only the March Hare said--',Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'You did!' said the Hatter.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'I deny it!' said the March Hare.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nothing, being fast asleep.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"head first, and then sat upon it.)",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,'Call the next witness!' said the King.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,she had accidentally upset the week before.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,they would die.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,"great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,court.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"to himself in an undertone,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

11,what a wonderful dream it had been.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,this was her dream:--,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,of her little sister's dream.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,Turtle.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,heavy sobs.,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,"make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
11,with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

1260,"I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"doubt the tendency of such books as ""Jane Eyre:"" in whose eyes whatever",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,would remind them of certain simple truths.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Thorns.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and clearly the line of separation between them.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Vanity Fair"" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,alien permanently intruded on her own family group.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror--I began to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and rooted aversion.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with a fire, where she left me alone.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"grave, her bearing erect.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""The child is very young to be sent alone,"" said she, putting her candle",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,then further added--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?"" she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""A little, ma'am.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"come to school, my little girl?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"forefinger, and saying, ""She hoped I should be a good child,"" dismissed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,me along with Miss Miller.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to the top of the long room she cried out--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Form classes!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"repeatedly exclaimed, ""Silence!"" and ""Order!""  When it subsided, I saw",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"called, and placed at the bottom of it.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,little the day before.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the first class, rose the whispered words--",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Silence!"" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the meal began.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"them, the stout one, whispered--",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Abominable stuff!  How shameful!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,wrath; doubtless she shared in it.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"standing in the middle of the room, cried--",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Silence!  To your seats!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"given ""To the garden!""  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hollow cough.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,this inscription:--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"still pondering the signification of ""Institution,"" and endeavouring to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"title--it was ""Rasselas;"" a name that struck me as strange, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Burns"" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), ""Burns, you are standing on the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.""  ""Burns, you poke",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.""  ""Burns, I insist on your",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"morning!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  ""Why,"" thought I, ""does",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"as the water was frozen?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,altered its ordinary expression.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,CHAPTER VII,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,were no trifles.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"meals, was served round between the services.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"spirits, and march forward, as she said, ""like stalwart soldiers.""  The",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to attempt the task of cheering others.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,starved arms in their pinafores.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,invariably obliged to part with.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,propped up with the monitors' high stools.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"narrower, and more rigid than ever.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the ""Coming",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Man,"" whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"what authority?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,"" replied Miss Temple:",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,alleviate.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,connection.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,beneficial to the institution.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,testimony to its value and importance.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"county, and consequently was lost to me.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of the occasion.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,CHAPTER XI,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""boots"" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,troubling my thoughts.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the bell.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?"" I asked of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar.""  He",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""Yes.""  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""A matter of six miles.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,much at my ease.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""I suppose,"" thought I, ""judging from the plainness of the servant and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"road now, I wonder?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"more stirring, less romantic.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Will you walk this way, ma'am?"" said the girl; and I followed her across",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,itself to my view.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""I am so glad,"" she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the cat on her knee; ""I am so glad you are come; it will be quite",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"furnished in ordinary, modern style.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'"" I muttered.  ""Where",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?""  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,over which I had been gazing with delight.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,out the door whence the accents issued.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Mrs. Fairfax!"" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""Grace!"" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of her mind and character.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,what I believed in I wished to behold.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,every effort of that sort.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"having replied to her ""Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Jeannette,"" with a kiss I set out.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,blended clouds where tint melts into tint.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a ""Gytrash,"" which, in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,me.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"exclamation of ""What the deuce is to do now?"" and a clattering tumble,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,generally did not come back till late at night.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,causes quite disconnected with me.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,She appeared to know it by instinct.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  ""And mind,"" he",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"continued, ""don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, ""Who",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"is there?""  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,enough.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, ""Who is",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"there?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?"" thought I.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,burning.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Wake! wake!"" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,impression that he was sure to visit it that day.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of ""What a mercy master was not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"burnt in his bed!""  ""It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"night.""  ""How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"water-jug!""  ""I wonder he waked nobody!""  ""It is to be hoped he will not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,"" &c.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,no other than Grace Poole.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"guilt, or fear of detection.  She said ""Good morning, Miss,"" in her usual",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,went on with her sewing.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""I will put her to some test,"" thought I: ""such absolute impenetrability",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"is past comprehension.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""A strange affair!"" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,conscious eye.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Have you told master that you heard a laugh?"" she inquired.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,within the circlet of a band of gems.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,haughty lip.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"said, she liked flowers, ""especially wild ones;"" Miss Ingram had, and she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,with fluency and with a good accent.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,in spotless white.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""Now, Dent,"" continued Mr. Rochester, ""it is your turn.""  And as the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,returns in memory at this moment.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,not charm him_.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""What can possess him to come home in that style?"" said Miss Ingram.  ""He",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the curtain.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Good God!  What a cry!,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,voice shouted--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Help! help! help!"" three times rapidly.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Will no one come?"" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was silence.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ladies alike had quitted their beds; and ""Oh! what is it?""--""Who is",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hurt?""--""What has happened?""--""Fetch a light!""--""Is it fire?""--""Are there",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,confusion was inextricable.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Where the devil is Rochester?"" cried Colonel Dent.  ""I cannot find him",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in his bed.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"coming.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""What awful event has taken place?"" said she.  ""Speak! let us know the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"worst at once!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""But don't pull me down or strangle me,"" he replied: for the Misses",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""All's right!--all's right!"" he cried.  ""It's a mere rehearsal of Much",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"by an effort, he added--",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had left it.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Am I wanted?"" I asked.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""Come out, then, quietly.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"noise.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,little sister.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,was surrounded with a crape band.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,obeyed her as in bygone days.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lustrous and large.  ""Good! but not quite the thing,"" I thought, as I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and content.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Is that a portrait of some one you know?"" asked Eliza, who had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"other drawings pleased her much, but she called that ""an ugly man."" They",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"mother's sick-room, and no more.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she said, ""the Rubric.""  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,vary its clockwork regularity.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"invitation up to town.  ""It would be so much better,"" she said, ""if she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.""  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"did not ask what she meant by ""all being over,"" but I suppose she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,CHAPTER XXII,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"idle; and I thought to myself, ""If you and I were destined to live always",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"patient and compliant on my part.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,notes of condolence.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"One morning she told me I was at liberty.  ""And,"" she added, ""I am",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,some difference between living with such an one as you and with,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"To-morrow,"" she continued, ""I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"veil.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"good may it do you!""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"When we parted, she said: ""Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"you have some sense.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I then returned: ""You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""You are in the right,"" said she; and with these words we each went our",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,fortune.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to Thornfield was yet to be tried.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  ""You would be",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,"" was my mental comment.  ""I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"don't doubt it.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The question followed, ""Where was I to go?""  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,both her and me.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  ""Mrs.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,"" said I; ""and little",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"added--""Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"direction, ""Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London,"" on each: I could not",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  ""I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"will leave you by yourself, white dream,"" I said.  ""I am feverish: I hear",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,more than they.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to him, you shall share the confidence.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"listen to, and I ran off again.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,by one moving speck.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!"" I exclaimed, seized with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Well, I cannot return to the house,"" I thought; ""I cannot sit by the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,ever to reach the road.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,CHAPTER XXVIII,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and now, I am absolutely destitute.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,will seek her breast and ask repose.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,crag protected my head: the sky was over that.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,regained the faculty of reflection.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,then chose my couch.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg},Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,attempts to seek him.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,sleep forgot sorrow.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,looked round me.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,out.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,heard a bell chime--a church bell.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,like the rest.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,would not; but I must try.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"it.  Soon I asked her ""if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the village?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,apply somewhere.  Where?,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"do?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"needle-factory, and at the foundry.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Did Mr. Oliver employ women?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Nay; it was men's work.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""And what do the women do?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""I knawn't,"" was the answer.  ""Some does one thing, and some another.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Poor folk mun get on as they can.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,wanted.  I took leave.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,if a servant was wanted here?,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""No,"" said she; ""we do not keep a servant.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?"" I continued.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"no matter what.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"position, tale.  She shook her head, she ""was sorry she could give me no",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"information,"" and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,sentences of this sort at my bedside--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"""She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,that entranced theirs.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"we coincided, in short, perfectly.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,cheerful--,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"propose to myself?""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,minutes of apparently mournful meditation.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,delights they could yield.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,produced on me.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Looking up as I drew near--""You have a question to ask of me?"" he said.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,interest to me.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"could have done, and with less trouble.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"""You need be in no hurry to hear,"" he said: ""let me frankly tell you, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"working people, is like ""sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;"" serene",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,duties of the day.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, ""I love",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.""",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,there in the season to shoot.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and,Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
1260,"narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography

1260,"spot.""  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on",Jane Eyre: An Autobiography
