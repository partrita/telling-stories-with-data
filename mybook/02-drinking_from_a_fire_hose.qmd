Chapman and Hall/CRC published this book in July 2023. You can purchase that [here](https://www.routledge.com/Telling-Stories-with-Data-With-Applications-in-R/Alexander/p/book/9781032134772). This online version has some updates to what was printed.
:::

**Prerequisites**

- Read *The mundanity of excellence: An ethnographic report on stratification and Olympic swimmers*, [@chambliss1989mundanity]
  - This paper finds that excellence is not due to some special talent or gift, but instead due to technique, discipline, and attitude.
- Read *Data science as an atomic habit*, [@citeBarrett]
  - This blog post describes an approach to learning data science that involves making small, consistent, actions.
- Read *This is how AI bias really happens---and why it's so hard to fix*, [@hao2019]
  - This article highlights some of the ways in which models can perpetuate bias.

**Key concepts and skills**

- The statistical programming language R enables us to tell interesting stories using data. It is a language like any other, and the path to mastery can be slow.
- The workflow that we use to approach projects is: plan, simulate, acquire, explore, and share.
- The way to learn R is to start with a small project and break down what is required to achieve it into tiny steps, look at other people's code, and draw on that to achieve each step. Complete that project and move onto the next project. With each project you will get a little better.

**Software and packages**

- Base R [@citeR]
- Core `tidyverse` [@tidyverse]
  - `dplyr` [@citedplyr]
  - `ggplot2` [@citeggplot]
  - `tidyr` [@citetidyr]
  - `stringr` [@citestringr]

## Hello, World!

The way to start, is to start. In this chapter we go through three complete examples of the data science workflow advocated in this book.\index{workflow} This means we:

$$
\mbox{Plan} \rightarrow \mbox{Simulate} \rightarrow \mbox{Acquire} \rightarrow \mbox{Explore} \rightarrow \mbox{Share}
$$
If you are new to R, then some of the code may be a bit unfamiliar to you. If you are new to statistics, then some of the concepts may be unfamiliar. Do not worry. It will all soon become familiar.

The only way to learn how to tell stories, is to start telling stories yourself. This means that you should try to get these examples working. Do the sketches yourself, type everything out yourself (using Posit Cloud if you are new to R and do not have it locally installed), and execute it all. It is important to realize that it will be challenging at the start. This is normal.

> Whenever you're learning a new tool, for a long time, you're going to suck$\dots$ But the good news is that is typical; that's something that happens to everyone, and it's only temporary.
>
> Hadley Wickham as quoted by @citeBarrett.

You will be guided thoroughly here. Hopefully by experiencing the excitement of telling stories with data, you will feel empowered to stick with it.

The first step of the workflow is to plan. We do this because we need to establish an end-point, even if we later need to update it as we learn more about the situation. We then simulate because this forces us into the details of our plan. In some projects, data acquisition may be as straight-forward as downloading a dataset, but in others the data acquisition may be much of the focus, for instance, if we conduct a survey. We explore the data using various quantitative methods to come to understand it. And finally, we share our understanding, in a way that is focused on the needs of our audience.

To get started, go to [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud)\index{Posit Cloud} and create an account; the free version is fine for now. We use that initially, rather than the desktop, so that getting started is the same for everyone, but to avoid having to pay you should change to a local installation later. Once you have an account and log in, it should look something like @fig-02-rstudio_cloud-1.

:::{#fig-openrstudio layout-ncol="2" layout-valign="bottom"}
![Opening Posit Cloud for the first time](figures/02-posit_cloud-1.png){#fig-02-rstudio_cloud-1}

![Opening a new RStudio project](figures/02-posit_cloud-2.png){#fig-02-rstudio_cloud-2}

Getting started with Posit Cloud and a new project
:::

You will be in "Your Projects". From here you should start a new project: "New Project" $\rightarrow$ "New RStudio Project" (@fig-02-rstudio_cloud-2). You can give the project a name by clicking on "Untitled Project" and replacing it.

We will now go through three worked examples: Australian elections, Toronto shelter usage, and neonatal mortality. These examples build increasing complexity, but from the first one, we will be telling a story with data. While we briefly explain many aspects here, almost everything is explained in much more detail in the rest of the book.


## Australian elections

Australia\index{Australia} is a parliamentary democracy with 151 seats in the House of Representatives, which is the lower house and that from which government is formed.\index{elections!Australia 2022 Federal Election} There are two major parties---"Liberal" and "Labor"---two minor parties---"Nationals" and "Greens"---and many smaller parties and independents. In this example we will create a graph of the number of seats that each party won in the 2022 Federal Election.\index{elections}

### Plan

For this example, we need to plan two aspects. The first is what the dataset that we need will look like, and the second is what the final graph will look like.

The basic requirement for the dataset is that it has the name of the seat (sometimes called a "division" in Australia) and the party of the person elected. A quick sketch of the dataset that we would need is @fig-australiaexample-data.

:::{#fig-australiaexample layout-ncol="2" layout-valign="bottom"}

![Quick sketch of a possible graph of the number of seats won by each party](figures/02-divisiongraph.png){#fig-australiaexample-graph width="45%"}

Sketches of a potential dataset and graph related to an Australian election
:::

We also need to plan the graph that we are interested in. Given we want to display the number of seats that each party won, a quick sketch of what we might aim for is @fig-australiaexample-graph.

### Simulate

We now simulate some data, to bring some specificity to our sketches.

To get started, within Posit Cloud\index{Posit Cloud}, make a new Quarto\index{Quarto} document: "File" $\rightarrow$ "New File" $\rightarrow$ "Quarto document$\dots$". Give it a title, such as "Exploring the 2022 Australian Election", add your name as author, and unclick "Use visual markdown editor" (@fig-quarto-australian-elections-clcik). Leave the other options as their default, and then click "Create".

:::{#fig-quarto-australian-elections layout-nrow=3}

![Creating a new Quarto document](figures/02-posit_cloud-3.png){#fig-quarto-australian-elections-clcik}

![Installing rmarkdown if necessary](figures/02-posit_cloud-4.png){#fig-quarto-australian-elections-wtfquarto}

![After initial setup and with a preamble](figures/02-posit_cloud-5.png){#fig-quarto-australian-elections-3}

![Highlighting the green arrow to run the chunk](figures/02-posit_cloud-6.png){#fig-quarto-australian-elections-4}

![Highlighting the cross to remove the messages](figures/02-posit_cloud-7.png){#fig-quarto-australian-elections-5}

![Highlighting the render button](figures/02-posit_cloud-8.png){#fig-quarto-australian-elections-6}

Getting started with a Quarto document
:::


You may get a notification along the lines of "Package rmarkdown required$\dots$." (@fig-quarto-australian-elections-wtfquarto). If that happens, click "Install". For this example, we will put everything into this one Quarto document. You should save it as "australian_elections.qmd": "File" $\rightarrow$ "Save As$\dots$".

Remove almost all the default content, and then beneath the heading material create a new R code chunk: "Code" $\rightarrow$ "Insert Chunk". Then add preamble documentation that explains:

-   the purpose of the document;
-   the author and contact details;
-   when the file was written or last updated; and
-   prerequisites that the file relies on.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Read in data from the 2022 Australian Election and make
# a graph of the number of seats each party won.
# Author: Rohan Alexander
# Email: rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca
# Date: 1 January 2023
# Prerequisites: Know where to get Australian elections data.
```

In R, lines that start with "\#" are comments. This means that they are not run as code by R, but are instead designed to be read by humans. Each line of this preamble should start with a "\#". Also make it clear that this is the preamble section by surrounding that with "\####". The result should look like @fig-quarto-australian-elections-3.

After this we need to setup the workspace. This involves installing\index{packages!install} and loading any packages that will be needed. A package only needs to be installed once for each computer, but needs to be loaded each time it is to be used. In this case we are going to use the `tidyverse` and `janitor` packages. They will need to be installed because this is the first time they are being used, and then each will need to be loaded.

:::{.callout-note}
## Shoulders of giants

Hadley Wickham\index{Wickham, Hadley} is Chief Scientist at RStudio. After earning a PhD in Statistics from Iowa State University in 2008 he was appointed as an assistant professor at Rice University, and became Chief Scientist at RStudio, now Posit, in 2013.\index{statistics} He developed the `tidyverse` collection of packages, and has published many books including *R for Data Science* [@r4ds] and *Advanced R* [@advancedr]. He was awarded the COPSS Presidents' Award in 2019.\index{COPSS Presidents' Award}
:::

An example of installing the packages follows.\index{packages!install} Run this code by clicking the small green arrow associated with the R code chunk (@fig-quarto-australian-elections-4).

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#### Workspace setup ####
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
```

Now that the packages are installed, they need to be loaded. As that package installation step only needs to be done once per computer, that code should be commented out so that it is not accidentally run, or even just removed. Additionally, we can remove the message that printed when we installed the packages (@fig-quarto-australian-elections-5).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

#### Workspace setup ####
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("janitor")

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

We can render the entire document by clicking "Render" (@fig-quarto-australian-elections-6). When you do this, you may be asked to install some packages. If that happens, then you should agree to this. This will result in a HTML document.\index{Quarto!render HTML}

For an introduction to the packages that were just installed, each package contains a help file that provides information about them and their functions. It can be accessed by prepending a question mark to the package name and then running that code in the console. For instance `?tidyverse`.

To simulate our data,\index{simulation} we need to create a dataset with two variables: "Division" and "Party", and some values for each. In the case of "Division" reasonable values would be a name of one of the 151 Australian divisions. In the case of "Party" reasonable values would be one of the following five: "Liberal", "Labor", "National", "Green", or "Other". Again, this code can be run by clicking the small green arrow associated with the R code chunk.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

simulated_data <-
  tibble(
    # Use 1 through to 151 to represent each division
    "Division" = 1:151,
    # Randomly pick an option, with replacement, 151 times
    "Party" = sample(
      x = c("Liberal", "Labor", "National", "Green", "Other"),
      size = 151,
      replace = TRUE
    )
  )

simulated_data
```

At a certain point, your code will not run and you will want to ask others for help.\index{help!asking for} Do not take a screenshot of a small snippet of the code and expect that someone will be able to help based on that. They, almost surely, cannot. Instead, you need to provide them with your whole script in a way that they can run. We will explain what GitHub\index{GitHub} is more completely in @sec-reproducible-workflows, but for now, if you need help, then you should naively create a GitHub Gist which will enable you to share your code in a way that is more helpful than taking a screenshot. The first step is to create a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com) (@fig-githubone). Thinking about an appropriate username is important because this will become part of your professional profile. It would make sense to have a username that is professional, independent of any course, and ideally related to your real name. Then look for a "+" in the top right, and select "New gist" (@fig-githubgistone).

:::{#fig-githubgist layout-ncol="2" layout-nrow="2" layout-valign="bottom"}
![GitHub sign-up screen](figures/github_1.png){#fig-githubone}

![New GitHub Gist](figures/githubgistone.png){#fig-githubgistone}

![Create a public GitHub Gist to share code](figures/githubgisttwo.png){#fig-githubgisttwo}

Creating a Gist to share code when asking for help
:::

From here you should add all the code to that Gist, not just the final bit that is giving an error. And give it a meaningful filename that includes ".R" at the end, for instance, "australian_elections.R". In @fig-githubgisttwo it will turn out that we have incorrect capitalization, `library(Tidyverse)` instead of `library(tidyverse)`.

Click "Create public gist". We can then share the URL to this Gist with whoever we are asking to help, explain what the problem is, and what we are trying to achieve. It will be easier for them to help, because all the code is available.

### Acquire

Now we want to get the actual data. The data we need is from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)\index{Australia!Australian Electoral Commission}, which is the non-partisan agency that organizes Australian federal elections. We can pass a page of their website to `read_csv()` from `readr`. We do not need to explicitly load `readr` because it is part of the `tidyverse`. The `<-` or "assignment operator" allocates the output of `read_csv()` to an object called "raw_elections_data".

:::{.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#### Read in the data ####
raw_elections_data <-
  read_csv(
    file =
      paste0("https://results.aec.gov.au/27966/website/Downloads/",
             "HouseMembersElectedDownload-27966.csv"),
    show_col_types = FALSE,
    skip = 1
  )

# We save the original data in case we lose access
write_csv(
  x = raw_elections_data,
  file = "australian_voting.csv"
)
```
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="pdf"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#### Read in the data ####
raw_elections_data <-
  read_csv(
    file =
      "https://results.aec.gov.au/27966/website/Downloads/HouseMembersElectedDownload-27966.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE,
    skip = 1
  )

# We have read the data from the AEC website. We may like to save
# it in case something happens or they move it.
write_csv(
  x = raw_elections_data,
  file = "australian_voting.csv"
)
```
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

# INTERNAL

raw_elections_data <-
  read_csv(
    file =
      "https://results.aec.gov.au/27966/website/Downloads/HouseMembersElectedDownload-27966.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE,
    skip = 1
  )

write_csv(
  x = raw_elections_data,
  file = here::here("inputs/data/australian_voting.csv")
)
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

raw_elections_data <-
  read_csv(
    here::here("inputs/data/australian_voting.csv"),
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )
```

We can take a quick look at the dataset using `head()` which will show the first six rows, and `tail()` which will show the last six rows.

```{r}
head(raw_elections_data)
tail(raw_elections_data)
```

We need to clean the data so that we can use it. We are trying to make it similar to the dataset that we thought we wanted in the planning stage. While it is fine to move away from the plan, this needs to be a deliberate, reasoned decision. After reading in the dataset that we saved, the first thing that we will do is adjust the names of the variables. We will do this using `clean_names()` from `janitor`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

#### Basic cleaning ####
raw_elections_data <-
  read_csv(
    file = here::here("inputs/data/australian_voting.csv"),
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

#### Basic cleaning ####
raw_elections_data <-
  read_csv(
    file = "australian_voting.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# Make the names easier to type
cleaned_elections_data <-
  clean_names(raw_elections_data)

# Have a look at the first six rows
head(cleaned_elections_data)
```

The names are faster to type because RStudio\index{R!RStudio} will auto-complete them. To do this, we begin typing the name of a variable and then use the "tab" key to complete it.

There are many variables in the dataset, and we are primarily interested in two: "division_nm" and "party_nm". We can choose certain variables of interest with `select()` from `dplyr` which we loaded as part of the `tidyverse`. The "pipe operator"\index{pipe operator}, `|>`, pushes the output of one line to be the first input of the function on the next line.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

cleaned_elections_data <-
  cleaned_elections_data |>
  select(
    division_nm,
    party_nm
  )

head(cleaned_elections_data)
```

Some of the variable names are still not obvious because they are abbreviated. We can look at the names of the columns in this dataset with `names()`. And we can change the names using `rename()` from `dplyr`.

```{r}
names(cleaned_elections_data)
```

```{r}
cleaned_elections_data <-
  cleaned_elections_data |>
  rename(
    division = division_nm,
    elected_party = party_nm
  )

head(cleaned_elections_data)
```

We could now look at the unique values in the "elected_party" column using `unique()`.

```{r}
cleaned_elections_data$elected_party |>
  unique()
```

As there is more detail in this than we wanted, we may want to simplify the party names to match what we simulated, using `case_match()` from `dplyr`.

```{r}
cleaned_elections_data <-
  cleaned_elections_data |>
  mutate(
    elected_party =
      case_match(
        elected_party,
        "Australian Labor Party" ~ "Labor",
        "Liberal National Party of Queensland" ~ "Liberal",
        "Liberal" ~ "Liberal",
        "The Nationals" ~ "Nationals",
        "The Greens" ~ "Greens",
        "Independent" ~ "Other",
        "Katter's Australian Party (KAP)" ~ "Other",
        "Centre Alliance" ~ "Other"
      )
  )

head(cleaned_elections_data)
```

Our data now matches our plan (@fig-australiaexample-data). For every electoral division we have the party of the person that won it.

Having now nicely cleaned the dataset, we should save it, so that we can start with that cleaned dataset in the next stage. We should make sure to save it under a new file name so we are not replacing the raw data, and so that it is easy to identify the cleaned dataset later.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

write_csv(
  x = cleaned_elections_data,
  file = "cleaned_elections_data.csv"
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

write_csv(
  cleaned_elections_data,
  here::here("outputs/data/cleaned_elections_data.csv")
)
```

### Explore

We may like to explore the dataset that we created. One way to better understand a dataset is to make a graph. In particular, here we would like to build the graph that we planned in @fig-australiaexample-graph.

First, we read in the dataset that we just created.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

# Internal
cleaned_elections_data <-
  read_csv(
    file = "outputs/data/cleaned_elections_data.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

#### Read in the data ####
cleaned_elections_data <-
  read_csv(
    file = "cleaned_elections_data.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )
```

We can get a quick count of how many seats each party won using `count()` from `dplyr`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

cleaned_elections_data |>
  count(elected_party)
```

To build the graph that we are interested in, we use `ggplot2` which is part of the `tidyverse`. The key aspect of this package is that we build graphs by adding layers using "+", which we call the "add operator". In particular we will create a bar chart using `geom_bar()` from `ggplot2` (@fig-canadanice-1).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-canadanice
#| fig-cap: "Number of seats won, by political party, at the 2022 Australian Federal Election"
#| fig-subcap: ["Default options", "Improved theme and labels"]
#| layout-ncol: 2

cleaned_elections_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = elected_party)) + # aes abbreviates "aesthetics"
  geom_bar()

cleaned_elections_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = elected_party)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() + # Make the theme neater
  labs(x = "Party", y = "Number of seats") # Make labels more meaningful
```

@fig-canadanice-1 accomplishes what we set out to do. But we can make it look a bit nicer by modifying the default options and improving the labels (@fig-canadanice-2).

### Share

To this point we have downloaded some data, cleaned it, and made a graph. We would typically need to communicate what we have done at some length. In this case, we can write a few paragraphs about what we did, why we did it, and what we found to conclude our workflow. An example follows.

> Australia is a parliamentary democracy with 151 seats in the House of Representatives, which is the house from which government is formed. There are two major parties---"Liberal" and "Labor"---two minor parties---"Nationals" and "Greens"---and many smaller parties. The 2022 Federal Election occurred on 21 May, and around 15 million votes were cast. We were interested in the number of seats that were won by each party.
>
> We downloaded the results, on a seat-specific basis, from the Australian Electoral Commission website. We cleaned and tidied the dataset using the statistical programming language R [@citeR] including the `tidyverse` [@tidyverse] and `janitor` [@janitor]. We then created a graph of the number of seats that each political party won (@fig-canadanice).
>
> We found that the Labor Party won 77 seats, followed by the Liberal Party with 48 seats. The minor parties won the following number of seats: the Nationals won 10 seats and the Greens won 4 seats. Finally, there were 10 Independents elected as well as candidates from smaller parties.
>
> The distribution of seats is skewed toward the two major parties which could reflect relatively stable preferences on the part of Australian voters, or possibly inertia due to the benefits of already being a major party such a national network or funding. A better understanding of the reasons for this distribution are of interest in future work. While the dataset consists of everyone who voted, it worth noting that in Australia some are systematically excluded from voting, and it is much more difficult for some to vote than others.

One aspect to be especially concerned with is making sure that this communication is focused on the needs of the audience and telling a story. Data journalism provides some excellent examples of how analysis needs to be tailored to the audience, for instance, @biasbehindbars and @bronnerftw.


## Toronto's unhoused population

Toronto\index{Canada!Toronto unhoused population} has a large unhoused population [@torontohomeless]. Freezing winters mean it is important there are enough places in shelters. In this example we will make a table of shelter usage in 2021 to compare average use in each month. Our expectation is that there is greater usage in the colder months, for instance, December, compared with warmer months, for instance, July.

### Plan

The dataset that we are interested in would need to have the date, the shelter, and the number of beds that were occupied that night. A quick sketch of a dataset that would work is @fig-torontohomeless-data. We are interested in creating a table that has the monthly average number of beds occupied each night. The table would probably look something like @fig-torontohomeless-table.

### Simulate

The next step is to simulate some data that could resemble our dataset.\index{simulation} Simulation provides us with an opportunity to think deeply about our data generating process. When we turn to analysis, it will provide us with a guide. Conducting analysis without first using simulation can be thought of as shooting arrows without a target---while you are certainly doing something, it is not clear whether you are doing it well.

In Posit Cloud\index{Posit Cloud} make a new Quarto\index{Quarto} document, save it, and make a new R code chunk and add preamble documentation. Then install and/or load the packages that are needed. We will again use the `tidyverse` and `janitor`. As those were installed earlier, they do not need to be installed again. We will also use `lubridate`. That is part of the `tidyverse` and so does not need to be installed independently, but it does need to be loaded. We will also use `opendatatoronto`, and `knitr` and these will need to be installed and loaded.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Get data on 2021 shelter usage and make table
# Author: Rohan Alexander
# Email: rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca
# Date: 1 July 2022
# Prerequisites: -

#### Workspace setup ####
install.packages("opendatatoronto")
install.packages("knitr")

library(knitr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(opendatatoronto)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(knitr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(opendatatoronto)
library(tidyverse)
```

To add a bit more detail to the earlier example, packages contain code that other people have written. There are a few common ones that you will see regularly in this book, especially the `tidyverse`. To use a package, we must first install it and then we need to load it. A package only needs to be installed once per computer but must be loaded every time. This means the packages that we installed earlier do not need to be reinstalled here.

Given that people donate their time to make R and the packages that we use, it is important to cite them. To get the information that is needed, we use `citation()`.\index{citation!R} When run without any arguments, that provides the citation information for R itself, and when run with an argument that is the name of a package, it provides the citation information for that package.\index{packages!cite}\index{citation!R packages}

```{r}
citation() # Get the citation information for R
citation("ggplot2") # Get citation information for a package
```

Turning to the simulation, we need three variables: "date", "shelter", and "occupancy". This example will build on the earlier one by adding a seed using `set.seed()`.\index{random seed} A seed enables us to always generate the same random data whenever we run the same code. Any integer can be used as the seed. In this case the seed will be 853. If you use that as your seed, then you should get the same random numbers as in this example. If you use a different seed, then you should expect different random numbers. Finally, we use `rep()` to repeat something a certain number of times. For instance, we repeat "Shelter 1" 365 times which accounts for about a year.\index{distribution!Poisson}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

#### Simulate ####
set.seed(853)

simulated_occupancy_data <-
  tibble(
    date = rep(x = as.Date("2021-01-01") + c(0:364), times = 3),
    # Based on Eddelbuettel: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21502386
    shelter = c(
      rep(x = "Shelter 1", times = 365),
      rep(x = "Shelter 2", times = 365),
      rep(x = "Shelter 3", times = 365)
    ),
    number_occupied =
      rpois(
        n = 365 * 3,
        lambda = 30
      ) # Draw 1,095 times from the Poisson distribution
  )

head(simulated_occupancy_data)
```

In this simulation we first create a list of all the dates in 2021. We repeat that list three times. We assume data for three shelters for every day of the year. To simulate the number of beds that are occupied each night, we draw from a Poisson distribution\index{distribution!Poisson}, assuming a mean number of 30 beds occupied per shelter, although this is just an arbitrary choice. By way of background, a Poisson distribution is often used when we have count data, and we return to it in @sec-its-just-a-generalized-linear-model.

### Acquire

We use data made available about Toronto shelter usage by the City of Toronto. Shelter usage is measured by a count made each night at 4 a.m. of the number of occupied beds. To access the data, we use `opendatatoronto` and then save our own copy.

Not much needs to be done to this to make it similar to the dataset that we were interested in (@fig-torontohomeless-data). We need to change the names to make them easier to type using `clean_names()`, and reduce the columns to only those that are relevant using `select()`.

```{r}
toronto_shelters_clean <-
  clean_names(toronto_shelters) |>
  mutate(occupancy_date = ymd(occupancy_date)) |>
  select(occupancy_date, occupied_beds)

head(toronto_shelters_clean)
```

All that remains is to save the cleaned dataset.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

write_csv(
  x = toronto_shelters_clean,
  file = "cleaned_toronto_shelters.csv"
)
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

write_csv(
  x = toronto_shelters_clean,
  file = here::here("outputs/data/cleaned_toronto_shelters.csv")
)
```

### Explore

First, we load the dataset that we just created.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

toronto_shelters_clean <-
  read_csv(
    "outputs/data/cleaned_toronto_shelters.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

#### Explore ####
toronto_shelters_clean <-
  read_csv(
    "cleaned_toronto_shelters.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )
```

The dataset contains daily records for each shelter. We are interested in understanding average usage for each month. To do this, we need to add a month column using `month()` from `lubridate`. By default, `month()` provides the number of the month, and so we include two arguments---"label" and "abbr"---to get the full name of the month. We remove rows that do not have any data for the number of beds using `drop_na()` from `tidyr`, which is part of the `tidyverse`. We will do this here unthinkingly because our focus is on getting started, but this is an important decision and we talk more about missing data in @sec-farm-data and @sec-exploratory-data-analysis. We then create a summary statistic on the basis of monthly groups, using `summarise()` from `dplyr`. We use `tt()` from `tinytable` to create @tbl-homelessoccupancyd.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-homelessoccupancyd
#| tbl-cap: "Shelter usage in Toronto in 2021"

toronto_shelters_clean |>
  mutate(occupancy_month = month(
    occupancy_date,
    label = TRUE,
    abbr = FALSE
  )) |>
  arrange(month(occupancy_date)) |>
  drop_na(occupied_beds) |>
  summarise(number_occupied = mean(occupied_beds),
            .by = occupancy_month) |>
  tt()
```

As with before, this looks fine, and achieves what we set out to do. But we can make some tweaks to the defaults to make it look even better (@tbl-homelessoccupancy). In particular we make the column names easier to read, only show an appropriate number of decimal places, and change the alignment (`j` is used to specify the column number of interest and `r` is the alignment type i.e. right).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-homelessoccupancy
#| tbl-cap: "Shelter usage in Toronto in 2021"

toronto_shelters_clean |>
  mutate(occupancy_month = month(
    occupancy_date,
    label = TRUE,
    abbr = FALSE
  )) |>
  arrange(month(occupancy_date)) |>
  drop_na(occupied_beds) |>
  summarise(number_occupied = mean(occupied_beds),
            .by = occupancy_month) |>
  tt(
    digits = 1
  ) |>
  style_tt(j = 2, align = "r") |>
  setNames(c("Month", "Average daily number of occupied beds"))
```

### Share

We need to write a few brief paragraphs about what we did, why we did it, and what we found to sum up our work. An example follows.

> Toronto has a large unhoused population. Freezing winters mean it is critical there are enough places in shelters. We are interested to understand how usage of shelters changes in colder months, compared with warmer months.
>
> We use data provided by the City of Toronto about Toronto shelter bed occupancy. Specifically, at 4 a.m. each night a count is made of the occupied beds. We are interested in averaging this over the month. We cleaned, tidied, and analyzed the dataset using the statistical programming language R [@citeR] as well as the `tidyverse` [@Wickham2017], `janitor` [@janitor], `opendatatoronto` [@citeSharla], `lubridate` [@GrolemundWickham2011], and `knitr` [@citeknitr]. We then made a table of the average number of occupied beds each night for each month (@tbl-homelessoccupancy).
>
> We found that the daily average number of occupied beds was higher in December 2021 than July 2021, with 34 occupied beds in December, compared with 30 in July (@tbl-homelessoccupancy). More generally, there was a steady increase in the daily average number of occupied beds between July and December, with a slight overall increase each month.
>
> The dataset is on the basis of shelters, and so our results may be skewed by changes that are specific to especially large or small shelters. It may be that specific shelters are particularly attractive in colder months. Additionally, we were concerned with counts of the number of occupied beds, but if the supply of beds changes over the season, then an additional statistic of interest would be the proportion occupied.

Although this example is only a few paragraphs, it could be reduced to form an abstract, or increased to form a full report, for instance, by expanding each paragraph into a section. The first paragraph is a general overview, the second focuses on the data, the third on the results, and the fourth is a discussion. Following the example of @hao2019, that fourth paragraph is a good place to consider areas in which bias may have crept in.

## Neonatal mortality

Neonatal mortality\index{neonatal mortality} refers to a death that occurs within the first month of life. The neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is the number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births [@unigme]. The Third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) calls for a reduction in NMR to 12. In this example we will create a graph of the estimated NMR for the past 50 years for: Argentina\index{Argentina!neonatal mortality}, Australia\index{Australia!neonatal mortality}, Canada\index{Canada!neonatal mortality}, and Kenya\index{Kenya!neonatal mortality}.

### Plan

For this example, we need to think about what our dataset should look like, and what the graph should look like.

The dataset needs to have variables that specify the country and the year. It also needs to have a variable with the NMR estimate for that year for that country. Roughly, it should look like @fig-nmrexample-data.

:::{#fig-nmrexample layout-ncol="2"}
![Quick sketch of a potentially useful NMR dataset](figures/02-nmr_dataset_sketch.png){#fig-nmrexample-data}

![Quick sketch of a graph of NMR by country over time](figures/02-NMRgraph.png){#fig-nmrexample-graph}

Sketches of a dataset and graph about the neonatal mortality rate (NMR)
:::

We are interested to make a graph with year on the x-axis and estimated NMR on the y-axis. Each country should have its own series. A quick sketch of what we are looking for is @fig-nmrexample-graph.

### Simulate

We would like to simulate some data that aligns with our plan. In this case we will need three columns: country, year, and NMR.\index{simulation}

Within Posit Cloud\index{Posit Cloud}, make a new Quarto document\index{Quarto} and save it. Add preamble documentation and set up the workspace. We will use the `tidyverse`, `janitor`, and `lubridate`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Obtain and prepare data about neonatal mortality for
# four countries for the past fifty years and create a graph.
# Author: Rohan Alexander
# Email: rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca
# Date: 1 July 2022
# Prerequisites: -

#### Workspace setup ####
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
```

The code contained in packages can change from time to time as the authors update it and release new versions. We can see which version of a package we are using with `packageVersion()`. For instance, we are using version 2.0.0 of the `tidyverse` and version 2.2.0 of `janitor`.

```{r}
packageVersion("tidyverse")
packageVersion("janitor")
```

To update the version of all of the packages that we have installed, we use `update.packages()`.\index{packages!update} We can use `tidyverse_update()` to just install the `tidyverse` packages. This does not need to be run, say, every day, but from time to time it is worth updating packages. While many packages take care to ensure backward compatibility, at a certain point this does not become possible. Updating packages could result in old code needing to be rewritten. This is not a big deal when you are getting started and in any case there are tools aimed at loading particular versions that we cover in @sec-reproducible-workflows.

Returning to the simulation, we repeat the name of each country 50 times with `rep()`, and enable the passing of 50 years. Finally, we draw from the uniform distribution with `runif()` to simulate an estimated NMR value for that year for that country.\index{distribution!uniform}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

#### Simulate data ####
set.seed(853)

simulated_nmr_data <-
  tibble(
    country =
      c(rep("Argentina", 50), rep("Australia", 50),
        rep("Canada", 50), rep("Kenya", 50)),
    year =
      rep(c(1971:2020), 4),
    nmr =
      runif(n = 200, min = 0, max = 100)
  )

head(simulated_nmr_data)
```

While this simulation works, it would be time consuming and error prone if we decided that instead of 50 years, we were interested in simulating, say, 60 years. One way to improve this code is to replace all instances of 50 with a variable.\index{simulation}\index{distribution!uniform}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

#### Simulate data ####
set.seed(853)

number_of_years <- 50

simulated_nmr_data <-
  tibble(
    country =
      c(rep("Argentina", number_of_years), rep("Australia", number_of_years),
        rep("Canada", number_of_years), rep("Kenya", number_of_years)),
    year =
      rep(c(1:number_of_years + 1970), 4),
    nmr =
      runif(n = number_of_years * 4, min = 0, max = 100)
  )

head(simulated_nmr_data)
```

The result will be the same, but now if we want to change from 50 to 60 years, we only have to make the change in one place.

We can have confidence in this simulated dataset because it is relatively straight forward, and we wrote the code for it.\index{confidence!establishing} But when we turn to the real dataset, it is more difficult to be sure that it is what it claims to be. Even if we trust the data, we need to be able to share that confidence with others. One way forward is to establish some tests of whether our data are as they should be. For instance, we expect:\index{testing}

1.  That "country" is exclusively one of these four: "Argentina", "Australia", "Canada", or "Kenya".
2.  Conversely, "country" contains all those four countries.
3.  That "year" is no smaller than 1971 and no larger than 2020, and is an integer, not a letter or a number with decimal places.
4.  That "nmr" is a value somewhere between 0 and 1,000, and is a number.

We can write a series of tests based on these features, that we expect the dataset to pass.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

simulated_nmr_data$country |>
  unique() == c("Argentina", "Australia", "Canada", "Kenya")

simulated_nmr_data$country |>
  unique() |>
  length() == 4

simulated_nmr_data$year |> min() == 1971
simulated_nmr_data$year |> max() == 2020
simulated_nmr_data$nmr |> min() >= 0
simulated_nmr_data$nmr |> max() <= 1000
simulated_nmr_data$nmr |> class() == "numeric"
```

Having passed these tests, we can have confidence in the simulated dataset.\index{confidence!establishing} More importantly, we can apply these tests to the real dataset. This enables us to have greater confidence in that dataset and to share that confidence with others.

### Acquire

The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME)\index{UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation} [provides](https://childmortality.org/) NMR estimates that we can download and save.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

#### Acquire data ####
raw_igme_data <-
  read_csv(
    file =
      "https://childmortality.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/UNIGME-2021.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )

write_csv(x = raw_igme_data, file = "igme.csv")
```


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

raw_igme_data <-
  read_csv(
    file =

    show_col_types = FALSE
  )

arrow::write_parquet(
  x = raw_igme_data,
  sink = "inputs/data/igme.parquet"
)
```



```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

raw_igme_data <-
  arrow::read_parquet(
    file = "inputs/data/igme.parquet"
)
```

With established data, such as this, it can be useful to read supporting material about the data. In this case, a codebook\index{data!codebook} is available [here](https://childmortality.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CME-Info_codebook_for_downloads.xlsx). After this we can take a quick look at the dataset to get a better sense of it. We might be interested in what the dataset looks like with `head()` and `tail()`, and what the names of the columns are with `names()`.

:::{.content-visible unless-format="pdf"}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

head(raw_igme_data)
```
:::

```{r}
names(raw_igme_data)
```

We would like to clean up the names and only keep the rows and columns that we are interested in. Based on our plan, we are interested in rows where "Sex" is "Total", "Series Name" is "UN IGME estimate", "Geographic area" is one of "Argentina", "Australia", "Canada", and "Kenya", and the "Indicator" is "Neonatal mortality rate". After this we are interested in just a few columns: "geographic_area", "time_period", and "obs_value".

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

cleaned_igme_data <-
  clean_names(raw_igme_data) |>
  filter(
    sex == "Total",
    series_name == "UN IGME estimate",
    geographic_area %in% c("Argentina", "Australia", "Canada", "Kenya"),
    indicator == "Neonatal mortality rate"
    ) |>
  select(geographic_area, time_period, obs_value)

head(cleaned_igme_data)
```

We need to fix two other aspects: the class of "time_period" is character when we need it to be a year, and the name of "obs_value" should be "nmr" to be more informative.

```{r}
cleaned_igme_data <-
  cleaned_igme_data |>
  mutate(
    time_period = str_remove(time_period, "-06"),
    time_period = as.integer(time_period)
  ) |>
  filter(time_period >= 1971) |>
  rename(nmr = obs_value, year = time_period, country = geographic_area)

head(cleaned_igme_data)
```

Finally, we can check that our dataset passes the tests that we developed based on the simulated dataset.

```{r}
cleaned_igme_data$country |>
  unique() == c("Argentina", "Australia", "Canada", "Kenya")

cleaned_igme_data$country |>
  unique() |>
  length() == 4

cleaned_igme_data$year |> min() == 1971
cleaned_igme_data$year |> max() == 2020
cleaned_igme_data$nmr |> min() >= 0
cleaned_igme_data$nmr |> max() <= 1000
cleaned_igme_data$nmr |> class() == "numeric"
```

All that remains is to save the nicely cleaned dataset.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

write_csv(x = cleaned_igme_data, file = "cleaned_igme_data.csv")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

write_csv(
  x = cleaned_igme_data,
  file = here::here("outputs/data/cleaned_igme_data.csv")
)
```

### Explore

We would like to make a graph of estimated NMR using the cleaned dataset. First, we read in the dataset.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

cleaned_igme_data <-
  read_csv(
    "outputs/data/cleaned_igme_data.csv",

cleaned_igme_data <-

```

We can now make a graph of how NMR has changed over time and the differences between countries (@fig-nmrgraph).

```{r}
#| label: fig-nmrgraph
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR), for Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Kenya (1971-2020)"

  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR)", color = "Country") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Share

To this point we downloaded some data, cleaned it, wrote some tests, and made a graph. We would typically need to communicate what we have done at some length. In this case, we will write a few paragraphs about what we did, why we did it, and what we found.

> Neonatal mortality refers to a death that occurs within the first month of life. In particular, the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is the number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. We obtain estimates for NMR for four countries---Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Kenya---over the past 50 years.
>
> The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME) provides estimates of the NMR at the website: https://childmortality.org/. We downloaded their estimates then cleaned and tidied the dataset using the statistical programming language R [@citeR].
>
> We found considerable change in the estimated NMR over time and between the four countries of interest (@fig-nmrgraph). We found that the 1970s tended to be associated with reductions in the estimated NMR. Australia and Canada were estimated to have a low NMR at that point and remained there through 2020, with further slight reductions. The estimates for Argentina and Kenya continued to have substantial reductions through 2020.
>
> Our results suggest considerable improvements in estimated NMR over time. NMR estimates are based on a statistical model and underlying data. The double burden\index{data!double burden} of data is that often high-quality data are less easily available for groups, in this case countries, with worse outcomes. Our conclusions are subject to the model that underpins the estimates and the quality of the underlying data, and we did not independently verify either of these.

## Concluding remarks

We have covered much ground in this chapter, and it is normal to have not followed it all. The best way to proceed is to go through each of the three case studies in your own time. Type all the code out yourself, rather than copy-pasting, and run it bit by bit, even if you do not entirely understand what it is doing. Then try to add your own comments to it.

It is also the case that it is not necessary to fully understand everything in this chapter at this point. Some students find it best to continue going through the next few chapters of this book, and return to this one later. Excitingly we have shown that with just an hour or two of work it is possible to use data to learn something about the world. As we develop those skills we want to also consider, with increasing sophistication, about the broader impacts of our work.

> "We shouldn't have to think about the societal impact of our work because it's hard and other people can do it for us" is a really bad argument. I stopped doing CV [computer vision] research because I saw the impact my work was having. I loved the work but the military applications and privacy concerns eventually became impossible to ignore. But basically all facial recognition work would not get published if we took Broader Impacts sections seriously. There is almost no upside and enormous downside risk. To be fair though I should have a lot of humility here. For most of grad school I bought in to the myth that science is apolitical and research is objectively moral and good no matter what the subject is.

Although the term "data science" is ubiquitous in academia, industry, and even more generally, as we have seen, it is difficult to define. One deliberately antagonistic definition of data science is "[t]he inhumane reduction of humanity down to what can be counted" [@keyes2019]. While purposefully controversial, this definition highlights one reason for the increased demand for data science and quantitative methods over the past decade---individuals and their behavior are now at the heart of it. Many of the techniques have been around for many decades, but what makes them popular now is this human focus.

Unfortunately, even though much of the work may be focused on individuals, the issues of privacy and consent, and ethical concerns more broadly, rarely seem front of mind. While there are some exceptions, in general, even at the same time as claiming that AI, machine learning, and data science are going to revolutionize society, consideration of these types of issues appears to have been largely treated as something that would be nice to have, rather than something that we may like to think of before we embrace the revolution.

For the most part, these types of issues are not new. In the sciences, there has been extensive ethical consideration around CRISPR technology and gene editing [@brokowski2019crispr; @marchese2022]. And in an earlier time similar conversations were had, for instance, about Wernher von Braun being allowed to build rockets for the US despite having done the same for Nazi Germany [@neufeld2002wernher; @wilford1977]. In medicine these concerns have been front-of-mind for some time [@american1848code]. Data science seems determined to have its own Tuskegee-moment rather than think about, and proactively address, these issues based on the experiences of other fields.

That said, there is some evidence that some data scientists are beginning to be more concerned about the ethics surrounding the practice. For instance, NeurIPS, a prestigious machine learning conference, has required a statement on ethics to accompany all submissions since 2020.

> In order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. Authors should take care to discuss both positive and negative outcomes.
>
> NeurIPS 2020 Conference Call For Papers

The purpose of ethical consideration and concern for the broader impact of data science is not to prescriptively rule things in or out, but to provide an opportunity to raise some issues that should be paramount. The variety of data science applications, the relative youth of the field, and the speed of change, mean that such considerations are sometimes knowingly set aside, and this is acceptable to the rest of the field. This contrasts with fields such as science, medicine, engineering, and accounting. Possibly those fields are more self-aware (@fig-personalprobability).

## Exercises

### Practice {.unnumbered}

1. *(Plan)* Consider the following scenario: *Every day for a year a person records whether they donated \$1, \$2, or \$3.* Please sketch what a dataset could look like, and then sketch a graph that you could build to show all observations.
2. *(Simulate)* Please further consider the scenario described and simulate the situation. Carefully specify an appropriate situation using `sample()`. Then write five tests based on the simulated data.
3. *(Acquire)* Please specify a source of actual data about the amount of money that is donated to charity in a country that you are interested in.
4. *(Explore)* Load the `tidyverse` and use `geom_bar()` to make a bar chart.
5. *(Share)* Please write two paragraphs as if you had gathered data from the source you identified (rather than simulated), and if the graph that you built using simulated data reflected the actual situation. The exact details contained in the paragraphs do not have to be factual but they should be reasonable (i.e. you do not actually have to get the data nor create the graphs).

### Task {.unnumbered}

The purpose of this task is to redo the Australian Elections example, but for Canada. It is a chance to work in a realistic setting because the Canadian situation has some differences, but the Australian example provides guardrails.

By way of background, Canada's parliament has 338 seats, also known as "ridings", in the House of Commons. The main political parties are: major parties: Liberal and Conservative; minor parties: Bloc Québécois, New Democratic, and Green; some smaller parties and independents. The steps you should follow are:

1. Plan:
    - Dataset: Each observation should include the riding name and the party of the elected candidate.
    - Graph: The graph should show the number of ridings won by each party.
2. Simulate:
    - Create a Quarto document.
    - Load necessary packages: `tidyverse`, and `janitor`.
    - Simulate election results by randomly assigning parties to ridings: Add numbers for the riding, then use `sample()` to randomly choose one of six options, with replacement, 338 times.
3. Acquire:
    - Download the CSV file from Elections Canada [here](https://www.elections.ca/res/rep/off/ovr2021app/53/data_donnees/table_tableau11.csv).
    - Clean the names, and then select the two columns that are of interest: "electoral_district_name_nom_de_circonscription", and "elected_candidate_candidat_elu". Finally, rename the columns to remove the French and simplify the names.
    - The column that we need is about the elected candidates. That has the surname of the elected candidate, followed by a comma, followed by their first name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the party in both English and French, separated by a slash. Break-up this column into its pieces using `separate()` from `tidyr` and then use `select()` to just keep party information (some helper code is below).
    - Finally, recode the party names from French to English to match what we simulated.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

cleaned_elections_data <-
  cleaned_elections_data |>
  separate(
    col = elected_candidate,
    into = c("Other", "party"),
    sep = "/"
  ) |>
  select(-Other)
```

4. Explore:
    - Make a nice graph of the number of ridings won by each party in the 2021 Canadian Federal Election.
5. Share:
    - Write a few paragraphs about what you did, why you did it, and what you found. Submit a link to a GitHub Gist.
